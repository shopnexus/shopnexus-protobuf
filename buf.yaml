# The v2 buf.yaml file specifies a local workspace, which consists of at least one module.
# The buf.yaml file should be placed at the root directory of the workspace, which
# should generally be the root of your source control repository.
modules:
  # Each module entry defines a path, which must be relative to the directory where the
  # buf.yaml is located. You can also specify directories to exclude from a module.

    # A module can have its own lint and breaking configuration, which overrides the default
    # lint and breaking configuration in its entirety for that module. All values from the
    # default configuration are overridden and no rules are merged.
